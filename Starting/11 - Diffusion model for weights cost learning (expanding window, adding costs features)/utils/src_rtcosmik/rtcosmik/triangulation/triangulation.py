    Perform Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) for adaptive triangulation.
    This function computes the 3D coordinates of a point given its projections
    in multiple views using the DLT algorithm. It constructs a system of linear
    equations from the projection matrices and the corresponding 2D points, and
    then solves it using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
    Parameters:
    -----------
    projections : list of numpy.ndarray
        A list of 3x4 projection matrices for each view.
    points : list of numpy.ndarray
        A list of 2D points corresponding to each view. Each element in the list
        is an array of shape (n, 2), where n is the number of points.
    Returns:
    --------
    numpy.ndarray
        A 1D array of length 3 representing the 3D coordinates of the point.
